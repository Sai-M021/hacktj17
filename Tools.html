    <h4>Tool to Fix Compiler Errors</h4>
    <p>A compiler is like an interpreter, it reads the code that you write and translates it to bytecode, which is like computer language if
    you download this and run the .py file (it is just like a normal application) you can simply enter in your error and we will pull up
    and intuitive description of what is wrong and how to fix it. Hope this Helps! Also as a side note, you will need a python compiler to
    run our code so by downloading the compiler at Python official site (python.org) you are not only able to use this wonderful application
    you can also learn python in the future.</p>
